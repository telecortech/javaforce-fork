jPhoneLite consists of a few JAR files.

It is best to compile from the command prompt using ANT.

javaforce.jar - download from javaforce.sourceforge.net to get the full source to compile it.

jphonelite.jar - run ant in /jf/projects/jphonelite

The process to build the applet has recently changed.
A self-signed key is no longer used, but a CA is used instead.
To start you must first generate the JavaForce root CA key:
  cd /keys
  ant genca
And then come here and build the applet key:
  cd /projects/jphonelite
  ant genkey
This will build the KEY and CSR, then sign it with the CA key:
  cd /keys
  ant -Dname=jphonelite signkey
And then return here and import it:
  cd /projects/jphonelite
  ant importkey
And then you can build the applet:
  cd /projects/jphonelite
  ant sign-jar

Good luck!
