jBroadcast
===========

AutoDialer system written in Java using JavaForce SDK.
Dials each number in the list broadcasting your pre-recorded message and/or taking a survey.
The listener can be transfered to another number at anytime by pressed the transfer digit (default = 0).

Steps
-----

 1) Define your MySQL connection parameters.
 2) Click on "Create Database..." (only need to do this once)
 3) Define your SIP parameters (auth is optional and defaults to user) (if pass is blank it will use non-registered mode).
 4) Click on "Create List..." (define any name next to it such as dates or names)
 5) Select your list.
 6) Click on "Import List..." (files must be phone numbers lists - one per line)
 7) Set the # of lines to use (make sure you have enough bandwidth, about 90KiloBits per line for g711 or 40KiloBits per line for g729a)
 8) Define your messages and survey options.
 9) Click "Save Setup" for later use.
10) Click "Start!"

Notes
-----
WAV files must be 8000hz, 16bit, mono in PCM format (no compression).
Requires MySQL.
If you see a lot of 'system too slow : skipCount = x' messages you can either reduce # of lines or try disabling g729a.
The list of numbers is currently not editable.
If your WAV file(s) are too large you may get OutOfMemory exceptions,
  run java.exe with the -Xmx256m option to increase available memory (or make the change in your Java control panel:Java->View->Runtime Parameters).
    java.exe -Xmx256m -jar broadcast.jar
Anwsering machine detection is accomplished by starting after 1 second of silence after something is heard.
You can adjust the delay(ms) that is used between each attempt to start a new call (to prevent flooding your SIP server).
You can use "Fix List..." to change status from "calling" to "new" if you forced program to exit while calling.
Messages should be at least 5 seconds long.
The database structure changed in v0.7 so you will have to reload all your lists.  No upgrade is possible, use the export/import functions if needed.
The database keys were changed in v0.8 and an upgrade button is available.  This upgrade allows a number to exist in multiple lists but still only once per list.

Surveys
-------
Each message can record a response, either a single digit or long responses (which are stored in brackets).
The last message should give thanks and terminate the call.
The system will scan from 1 to 99 for enabled questions, play the message and wait for a response as defined.
The goto action will jump to another message based on what digit the user presses.  A zero disables that digit.
Responses are stored in the 'Survey' column after the call is completed.
