CHANGELOG
=========
3-12-2014 : v0.17 released
 - fix : Java8 compatible
2-1-2014 : v0.16 released
 - new : now supports DTLS between two VoIP phones
1-29-2014 : v0.15 released
 - new : WebRTC Phone can now call a standard VoIP Phone (such as jPhoneLite) [*experimental*]
   - the VoIP stack can now do DTLS handshaking (server side only) and process SRTP data
12-24-2013 : v0.14 released
 - new : added WebRTC conferencing (basically just copied apprtc.appspot.com - swapped out AppEngine Channel for WebSockets)
   - simple conferencing rooms for two guests each
   - the built in web service just transfers the SDP offers between guests using WebSockets, the PBX doesn't do any real "sip" work yet
   - hope to expand on support to have Web based phones that register and make calls, etc.
     - this would require implementing STUN/TURN service, DTLS channels, etc. (not an easy task)
   - only Firefox seems to work ('experimental') - the WebRTC standard is still not finalized yet
12-17-2013 : v0.13 released
 - new : relay options : relayAudio/relayVideo to specify if PBX will relay audio/video streams (default = enabled)
 - new : option : MusicOnHold can now load a wav file which is played to anyone on hold (if relayAudio is enabled)
   - to select a wav file goto Message page, upload a wav file and then select it from General Settings.
   - wav file must be 8000Hz, 16bit, mono PCM format as usual.
 - fixed/implemented Messages delete and rename functions
 - fixed blind transfer (non-blind still not implemented yet)
12-9-2013 : v0.12 released
 - new : Video Conferencing support (only tested with jPhoneLite/1.4.0)
   - see VideoConference.txt for more info
 - new : javaforce.voip.SDP class now contains all SDP related data
 - new : support for reinvites in both directions
 - new : support for call holding and playing MOH (an intermittent beep for now) to party on hold

 - new : added support for new video codecs (VP8, H.263+)
11-28-2013 : v0.10 released
 - new : added support for "received" and "rport" in the via field (RFC 3581)
   - this helps clients get around NATing firewalls
 - fix : docs and mis-packaging jars
9-17-2013 : v0.9 released
 - new : use embedded Derby database server instead of MySQL
 - new : use embedded web-server that listens on port 8001 to configure server instead of JavaEE (tomcat)
   - with both database and web-server built-in there are no external dependancies anymore (and it's 100% Java).
